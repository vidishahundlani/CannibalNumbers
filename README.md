# CannibalNumbers
#You'll be given two integers, i and j, on the first line. i indicates how many values you'll be given, and j indicates the number of #queries.

#Example: 

#7 2     
#21 9 5 8 10 1 3
#10 15

#Based on the above description, 7 is number of values that you will be given. 2 is the number of queries.

#That means -
#* Query 1 - How many numbers can have the value of at least 10
#* Query 2 - How many numbers can have the value of at least 15

#Your program should calculate and show the number of numbers which are equal to or greater than the desired number

#The result is:
#4 2
